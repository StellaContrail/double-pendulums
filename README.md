# doublependulum
### Fortran program which solves Lagrangian of Double Pendulum  
If you take one pendulum high up and release it, the pendulum moves periodically.  
However, if you combine two pendulum in a row and do the same thing, the top pendulum moves periodically as we expected, but the bottom one moves chaotically.  
This phenomenon is commonly known, and studied in a field called Chaos Theory.
